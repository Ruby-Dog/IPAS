Asset management
```
Asset management refers to a systematic approach to the governance and realization of value from the things that a group or entity is responsible for,
over their whole life cycles. 
It may apply both to tangible assets (physical objects such as buildings or equipment) and to intangible assets (such as human capital, intellectual property, goodwill or financial assets).
Asset management is a systematic process of developing, operating, maintaining, upgrading, and disposing of assets in the most cost-effective manner (including all costs, risks and performance attributes).
